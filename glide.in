$ This is the input file GLIDE
$ You can add as many comment lines as you wish, as long as they start with a
$   dollar sign!

$ (Input 1) Name of the run (also the name of the folder in which the solution is stored)
$ NOTE: You must create this folder manually before running GLIDE,along with one called unc inside
$ The name should be 5 letters long
$ useful to empty this folder
$   find RUN01 -type f -print0 | xargs -0 rm

RUN02

$ (Input 2) Name of the topo file used
$ The file should contain nx by ny elevation points (see below)
$    defining the topography in degrees,usually 0.0008333
$ Note that the evolution of this topography (in amplitude and elevation offset)
$    can change at each time step, as specified below in Input 12.

"data_ours/input.xyz"

$ (Input 3) Number of points (nx, ny) in the longitude and latitude directions
$  of the topography file being loaded.
$ 1200 2040 for previous DEM (FQM18072018.xyz)

7201 3601

$ (Input 4) Data file, containing lon,lat,z,a,e $$maybe,iflag

"data_ours/data_input.txt"


$ (Input 5) Region of interest, should be smaller than topography,
$ these limits correspond to west, east, south, and north

101.0 103.0 38.0 39.0

$ (Input 6) A priori estimate of the mean exhumation rate,
$ along with a uncertainity on this estimate in km/Myrs

$correlation parameters, anisotropy(i.e. strike could be the orogen), correlation length is isotropic
$ (Input 7) Correlation length scale, in km', angle perpendicular to strike, stretching along angle
$ the four parameter is to prescibe correlation in time
